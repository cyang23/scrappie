The vectorised math functions `src/sse_mathfun.h` are from

This project began life as a proof (bet) that a base caller could be written from scratch in a low level language in under 8 hours.  Some of the poor and just plain odd design decisions, along with the lack of documentation, are a result of its inception. In keeping with ONT's fish naming policy, the project was originally called Crappie (genus *Pomoxis*).


Scrappie's purpose is to demonstrate the next generation of base calling and, as such, may change drastically between releases and breaks backwards compatibility.  A new version may not support older features.



# Release history
The intention is that behaviour will be stable within a series, with only bug fixes or minor improvements being applied.  An improvement or change in behaviour that is not a major shift in the algorithm will be a new series with a bump of the minor version number.  Any major changes in the algorithm will be a new series with the major number bumped.
